    <ul>
    <li> A Programming Language Interpreter </li>
      <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; In this project, I build a interpreter for a custom language. This project was made in Python and Standard ML of New Jersey, My program parses through a list of commands in a text document. After going through
      the list of commands, my program will return a result depending on what the commands say. It works just like a regular programming languages with features such as functions and variable assignments. It also has basic things such as Boolean algebra and regular operations
     </p>
    <li>    Dyspense </li>
      <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; I created a website that allows doctors to log patient information into a database and depending on the patient, they will be alerted when it is time to take their medication. I was in charge of the backend of the web application that was in charge of taking the data the doctor input and
      actually calling the patients. I used Python for this and we used the Zang API. This was created during Developer Week Hackathon and we actually won 3rd place in the Zang API challenge.</p>
    <li>    Grapefruit </li>
      <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; A travel website that uses the Yelp API to give you an itinerary of your vacation. I did the backend of this project as well. My task was to take answers from the questionnaire and use the Yelp API to give the user a list of suggestions that they might like.
      It uses the search function in the Yelp API to determine what type of places a certain type of person might like and returns them in cards kind of like "Tinder" for Food/Attractions</p>
    <li> This website </li>
      <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; A personal website that I'm using to get a job <font color="#FFFFFF"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;hire me please </font> </p>
